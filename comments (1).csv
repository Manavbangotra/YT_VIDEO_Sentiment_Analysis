THE DEED IS DONE

OP Bro I like it 😍🙂
Bring this up on Music!

"A few days ago it officially became one year, and I haven’t felt an ounce of peace since. I can't even begin to imagine how much pain he had to go through, how helpless he fealt for God knows how long! Everyone talks about Justice, but what even is our ""Justice"" really? Even IF WE COULD put murderers in jail, that would have been NOTHING compared to the pain Sushant felt during that fateful period. I'm not saying we shouldn’t fight for justice, all I'm saying is, the murderers deserve to die little by little, very slowly and painfully. But what's the rheality? Lol. They are roaming free, thriving even. I think his death drove me to the point where l lost what little faith l had left in humanity. He left me with a permanent never ending void. I'll never ever be whole again... Only if I could hear him one last time, see that he's in a way better place, probably then l would have found a little peace... He doesn’t even come in my dreams, gone forever, gone gone gone..."

movie name ?
Beautiful people
"Sushant is perhaps the only one whose death caused more ""fans"" to pop up than when he was alive. Was a gem of a budding actor but sad to see his death getting tarnished by all the media and these fake fans who are ""sad"" for his death bcz everyone else is ""sad"". It's like a competition now in social media about claiming which of the fan is more ""sad"". Hope he finds peace in heaven."
How do you do that cinematic color grading......it's damn astheistic....❤️❤️✨
So addiction to this
Please upload all this songs to Spotify its my humble request 🙏🏼🙏🏼 I need this really badly 😢
"Love you SSR sir🙏

Sushant Singh Rajput may have gone but never Forgotten.
His death showed the ugly side of the entertainment industry. And in deep our hearts we knew that he didn't took his life. We were helpless.. we were cornered. Just like he may have felt in his last few breaths. Om Shaanti.

"The timing of this video is amazing. Can't believe he's gone and how he's gone 💔 Ugh Sushant Singh Rajput will live forever in the heart. Seriously, miss him loads. I never really appreciated him as an artist as much. Unfortunately, I liked him but never gave him to much of my attention amongst other actors. It's sad that one has to die to be called a legend. He was a living legend but not many appreciated him. So Just remember to be kind to everyone around you. You never know the battle anybody is fighting. RIP"
cryed
"Dk y it feels so sad 😩😩😩
When u don't even know a person genuinely ❤️🦷
Pure soul still shine inside out🖖🏻✨"
